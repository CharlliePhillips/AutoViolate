# AutoViolate
I made this GUI program to automatically "Tier Violate" or "Write Up" Lifeguards for not showing up for manditory training.
Names have been removed from test CSV for privacy.
Typing 80+ names and everything into that google form was taking too long, this gets it done in 5 minutes instead of an hour and a half.
My own custom google form is included for testing if you would like, I put in my own to again protect the privacy of X company and it's employees.
